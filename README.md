# CS499 ePortfolio – Pet Check-In

## What this is
Simple pet check-in system enhanced across milestones to show Software Engineering & Design, Algorithms & Data Structures, and Databases.

## How to run on Windows 
1. Install Node (LTS) and MongoDB.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill values.
3. `npm install`
4. Web: `npm run start`  |  CLI: `npm run start:cli`

# Introduction
The three artifacts in my ePortfolio come from the same project line so they tell one story:
• Software Engineering & Design – I refactored the original console idea into clear models with consistent naming and responsibilities.
• Algorithms & Data Structures – I added queues, stacks, hash maps, and binary search to improve fairness, speed, and control.
• Databases – I connected to MongoDB, enforced schema rules, added light indexing, and used an atomic capacity update to prevent double booking.

Together, these artifacts show that I can move a simple idea into a maintainable, testable, and safer system. They set the stage for the rest of the portfolio by demonstrating the range of my skills—from design and algorithms to persistence and security. The sections that follow will present the technical artifacts with short explanations of the problem, the approach, and what I learned.
